# Â¿WotMate? (Workout Tracker Mate)
Personal Workout Tracking Web Application
### About:
This is a personal project I started, to learn how to use React. The goal is to develop an application that allows users to quickly track workouts and provide graphical feedback on how they've been progressing. I want to include charts to visualize progress, saved routines to aid in consistency, and lists of exercises, including images and/or how-to videos.
